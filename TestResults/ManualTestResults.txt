Manual Tests
Browser Tested: Google Chrome only  
Platforms: Windows and Mac (These tests do not concern deployment issues)

Tests Performed:
1. Post Lost Items
   - Works in Chrome, bug where not uploading an associated picture with the post should be fixed
   - UI edge cases still need to be corrected

2. Login/Logout  
   - Critical functionality works
   - Edge cases like long usernames still need to be corrected

3. Claim Item  
   - Functionality not implemented, a workaround was figured out where the user would request an admin for an item after browsing,
     and then the admin would delete the item from the database on their end.

4. Search + Filters  
   - Able to filter by lost and found items, but not in depth filters added

5. Upload Image  
   - Accepts JPG/PNG, rejects weird formats
