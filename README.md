# UWB Lost and Found Portal
Our groupâ€™s project will be a UWB Lost and Found Portal application. On this application, users will be able to upload a picture, description, tags or additional notes about any lost item on campus. Additionally, they will be able to browse previously uploaded items in order to claim them. The browsing feature will be enhanced by a search function, as well as different filters you can sort the items by. 

The following are instructions to launch the UWB Lost and Found Portal Web Application:

1.Navigate to 360-Project-3-Main

2.If you're on Windows, double click on "RunOnWindows.bat". If you're on Mac, double click on "RunOnMac.sh"

3.The web application should take under 5 seconds to launch up, and under 30 if your system does not have Python installed.

At this point, hold control key and click on the server url. After clicking on the server url, you will be taken to the prototype site. Here, you can upload, claim, and give descriptions for items.
