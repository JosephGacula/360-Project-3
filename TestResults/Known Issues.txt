Known Issues
After the BugBash on 6/3, a couple of issues have been brought to our attention. Each issue will be listed below with a description.

Issue #1: Deployment is Inconsistent
Before the BugBash, we made sure to run the application on each of our systems using the one-click deployment methods to make sure the software would launch reliably. This included both Windows and Mac laptop.
However during the BugBash, a multitude of users were met with error messages on both operating systems. Windows was the most consistent with about two thirds of the users being able to deploy the application, and others
being met with a server not found error. Mac was more inconsistent. Some were able to launch it with the one-click deployment, but most were met with either the server not found error from before, or were having trouble using iTerm2
or the terminal to deploy the software.

Issue #2 UI Errors when Dealing with Edge Cases
During the BugBash, some participants were able to break the UI by inputting long reponses into input fields. This includes unreasonably long usernames showing up in full after making a post and stretching outside the post boxes,
being able to create and account with multiple spaces in front of the username, and long descriptions for items going outside the post box as well.
